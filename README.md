## Exercise 1 - SQL

Solution for exercise 1 is on route `/src/database/db.sql`.
<p>There is a database dump generated by me using MySQL Workbench only for testing purposes with the given queries, the 3 main exercises are at the bottom of the sql file.</p> 

## Exercise 2 - React

<p>The front-end part was done with React + TypeScript to ensure a better static typing that helps the compiler make sure the code is stronger and solid.</p>
<p>It also consumes an API [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) to simulate a PokÃ©dex which is limited to only 20 pokemons, there is a search bar and a button to filter and order all the results (by default it's already ordered by name)</p>
